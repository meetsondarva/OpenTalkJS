Title: Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Urban Water Management Systems in Coastal Cities: A Comparative Study of Adaptive Strategies and Stakeholder Engagement

Abstract:

Climate change is projected to significantly impact urban water management systems in coastal cities, posing significant risks to public health, infrastructure, and economic stability. This study examines the effects of climate change on urban water management systems in six coastal cities worldwide, with a focus on adaptive strategies and stakeholder engagement. Using a mixed-methods approach combining field observations, surveys, and interviews with key stakeholders, this research identifies key challenges and opportunities for improving urban water management resilience to climate change. Our results show that cities are adopting innovative adaptation strategies such as climate-resilient infrastructure design, green infrastructure integration, and participatory planning processes. However, stakeholder engagement and capacity building remain significant barriers to effective implementation. The study highlights the need for more inclusive and adaptive approaches to urban water management in coastal cities, which can be achieved through the following recommendations: (1) strengthen climate change adaptation policies and frameworks at local, national, and international levels; (2) invest in climate-resilient infrastructure design and maintenance; and (3) foster participatory and inclusive stakeholder engagement processes. By doing so, cities can minimize the negative impacts of climate change on their water management systems while maximizing their resilience and sustainability.

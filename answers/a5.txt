In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day,
A million leaves, like emeralds bright,
Dance in the breeze, with gentle might.

The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand watchful guard, their stories told,
Their branches stretch, a verdant dome,
A canopy above, a shelter home.

The river's voice, a melodic song,
Echoes through the valleys, all day long,
Its waters weaving, a silver thread,
Through hills and valleys, it gently spread.

The wind stirs flowers, like delicate wings,
And petals unfurl, in joyous springs,
Their sweet perfume, wafts through the air,
A symphony of scents, beyond compare.

In this grand tapestry, we're part,
A thread of life, a vital heart,
Connected to all, that's born,
A shared destiny, forever sworn.

So let us cherish, this world we see,
And honor nature, wild and free,
For in its beauty, we find our way,
To heal, to grow, and seize the day.
